 ShowBattery v.0.9

This is the source of the first SB release.
You must compile it with 
	gcc -Wall src/*.c -o showbattery `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0`  `pkg-config --cflags glib-2.0` -lnotify

but, before it, in the source code you must set the path you prefer.
Now, file that we call are in a directory ~/.showbattery , so you must create it and copy directory "icone" in ~/.showbattery. "icone" is in the src directory.

In the code we call file "info" too. It's most important because if you set ~/.showbattery , this file is used to remember your home.
However, you must set path of this file, and, to the start you must create it.

Now you can compile the code.

If you want, you can copy compiled file in /usr/bin/ to allow the direct execution, how i did.

enjoy it.
